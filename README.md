### Summary

This repository contains solutions to homework problems assigned in Math 5080/5090 from the text, Bain and Engelhardt's Introduction to Probability and Mathematical Statistics.

To view solutions, open the *.pdf files.

To make contributions, you will need to add/modify LaTeX files.  There is a master LaTeX file called Solutions.tex.  There is also a separate file for each homework problem.  Solutions.tex calls each of the separate homework problem files to compile a single document will all the solutions.  Thus if you want to fix or improve the solution to problem 5 from chapter 8, you will edit 05.08.tex and then compile Solutions.tex.

LaTeX files and Solutions.pdf will be tracked with git.  Please do not commit other stuff, e.g. log files.
